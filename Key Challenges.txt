Key Challenges for Community Links Working 

1. IT Access for all the support they need from across sectors. By being in the 3rd sector they can navigate this problem but will need key contacts in key areas for NHS and ACC
2. An issue of competition with Integration Partnership and Community Planning partners all tackling health issues in locality areas. a) Community Planning have 3 localities covering 20% of the population and b) Integration have 4 localities covering 100% of the population, but all plans cover health and well being, which causes confusion over remits, sharing data and cohesive working.
3. How does the Link Worker link in effectively to the other myria of support link workers across the sectors, across the city? Need to focus on the nine social determinants to begin with, plus clear job remits are essential. 
4. How would this proposed IT solution from CTC9 link to Health intelligence in terms of capturing statistical data and keeping decision makers informed in an equitable fashion?
